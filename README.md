# winston

A multi-transport async logging library for node.js.

### "CHILL WINSTON!" ... I put it in the logs.

## Installation

### Installing npm (node package manager)
<pre>
  curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
</pre>

### Installing winston
<pre>
  [sudo] npm install winston
</pre>

## Motivation
Winston is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of the winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file.
